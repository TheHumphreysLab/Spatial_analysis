# Spatial_analysis

### Scripts for imaging-based spatial data analysis
Plans:
1. Priori segmentation on DAPI with Cellpose
2. Cell segmentation with Baysor
3. Clustering on the segmented cells with Scanpy
4. Visualization of genes on cells projected to 2D tissue/UMAP
5. Compared Visium and Cartana
6. Tangram for snRNA-seq integration
7. Cell-cell communications in situ
