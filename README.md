# Spatial_analysis

### Scripts for imaging-based spatial data analysis
Plans:
1. Priori segmentation on DAPI with Cellpose
2. Cell segmentation with Baysor
3. Clustering on the segmented cells with Scanpy
4. Spatial domains analysis with SpaGCN
5. Visualization of genes on cells projected to 2D tissue/UMAP
6. Compared Visium and Cartana
7. Tangram for snRNA-seq integration
8. Cell-cell communications in situ
